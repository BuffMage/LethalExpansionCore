# LethalExpansionCore
This is a heavily de-bloated fork of [LethalExpansion](https://github.com/HolographicWings/LethalExpansion) down to the very core (adding scraps and moons with [LethalSDK](https://github.com/HolographicWings/LethalSDK-Unity-Project) modules). It acts as a simple library and does not add any features on its own\*. This is a drop in replacement for LethalExpansion and should be compatible with any mod relying on it, you can't run this and LethalExpansion at the same time.

\*There may still be some parts which are not required but the vast majority has been removed (I just haven't figured out what everything does yet)

## Features
- Support to load modules made with [LethalSDK](https://github.com/HolographicWings/LethalSDK-Unity-Project) to add new scraps and moons.

## Credits
All credit goes to the original mod and its creator!
